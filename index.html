    <p>A web developer is someone who builds websites and web applications.
         They use programming languages to create the structure and functionality of
          a website, as well as design elements to make it visually appealing. 
          There are different specializations of web developers, including front-end developers 
          (who focus on the user-facing side of the website), back-end developers
           (who focus on the server-side functionality), 
        and full-stack developers (who can handle both).</p>
